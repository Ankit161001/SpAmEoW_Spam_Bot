<h3>Instructions of Usage:</h3>
After the code is executed and the "SpAmEoW" window appears, enter the text that is to be spammed and the number of repetitions.
Please note that the words separated by " " will be printed in separate lines while spamming. So if the spam text is "Hellow World"
and the repetions are 5, then the total number of messages spammed will be 2 x 5 = 10 messages.
